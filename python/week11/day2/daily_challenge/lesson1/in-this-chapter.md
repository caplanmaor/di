# Right now up until now we’ve done what we call a route route that is the home road because in here we

# haven’t written anything.

# But sometimes in a Web site you might see something like blog write and if I hit enter you see that

# not fun that you are all was not found on the server again.

# That’s because right now our server is only waiting to hear for the route request.

# But if we type something like blog.

# Well there’s no function here that cares about that.
